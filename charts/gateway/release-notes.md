## 3.0.28 General Updates
- Added a [Startup probe](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/) for the Gateway Container.
  - Disabled by default

## 3.0.27 General Updates
- Default image updated to v11.1.00
  - Due to conflicting embedded Hazelcast versions between Gateway 10.x and 11.1, and between 11.0 and 11.1, a rolling update cannot be performed when upgrading to version 11.1 GA. Instead, follow the alternative steps:
    - Scale down your containers to zero.
      - Update the image tag to the target version (e.g., 11.1.00)
    - Scale up your containers back to their original state.
  - Hazelcast versions have not changed between 11.0 CR1/CR2 and 11.1 GA, rolling updates are supported between these Gateway versions.
- Added preview support for [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/)
  - Please see [Techdocs](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/ca-enterprise-software/layer7-api-management/api-gateway/11-1/install-configure-upgrade/configuring-opentelemetry-for-the-gateway.html) for more details about this integration
  - Preview feature (only available on Gateway v11.1.00)
  - An integration example is available [here](https://github.com/Layer7-Community/Integrations/tree/main/grafana-stack-prometheus-otel) that details how to deploy and configure an observability backend to use with the Gateway
    - OpenTelemetry is supported by [numerous vendors](https://opentelemetry.io/ecosystem/vendors/)
      - You are ***not required*** to use the observability stack that we provide as an example.
      - The observability stack that we provide ***is not*** production ready and should be used solely as an example or reference point.
  - [OpenTelemetry Configuration](./README.md#opentelemetry-configuration)
- Redis standalone now supports TLS and Password auth (only available on Gateway v11.1.00)
  - see [Redis configuration](./README.md#redis-configuration)
- Cipher Suites in [Gateway Application Ports](./README.md#gateway-application-ports) have been updated to reflect updates in Gateway v11.1.00. Please refer to [Techdocs](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/ca-enterprise-software/layer7-api-management/api-gateway/11-1/release-notes.html#concept.dita_ea0082004fb8c78a1723b9377f592085674b7ef7_jdk17) for more details.

> [!Important]  
> - To upgrade OTK to 4.6.2 installed over gateway with demo db as database, update helm repo, perform helm delete and install.
> - When upgrading OTK 4.6.2 on a db backed gateway, the gateway will restart as there is a change related to OTK health check bundle in gateway deployment. This can lead to failure of OTK upgrade. To circumvent this, please perform a helm upgrade `otk.healthCheckBundle.enabled` set to `false` and then upgrade to the 3.0.17.
> ```
> helm upgrade my-ssg --set-file "license.value=license.value=path/to/license.xml" --set "license.accept=true,otk.healthCheckBundle.enabled=false" layer7/gateway --version 3.0.16 -f ./values-production.yaml
> helm upgrade my-ssg --set-file "license.value=license.value=path/to/license.xml" --set "license.accept=true" layer7/gateway --version 3.0.17 -f ./values-production.yaml

The updates are applied to both the gateway and gateway-otk chart.

## 3.0.7 General Updates
The bootstrap script has been updated to reflect changes to the Container Gateway's filesystem. The updates are currently limited to 10.1.00_CR3. Please see the [InitContainer Examples](https://github.com/Layer7-Community/Utilities/tree/main/gateway-init-container-examples) for more info .

The PM Tagger image default version tag been updated to 1.0.1.

## 3.0.5 General Updates
The default image tag in values.yaml and production-values.yaml, and the appVersion in Chart.yaml have been updated to **11.0.00**.

Before upgrading existing deployments, please see the [Container Gateway 11.0 Release Notes](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/ca-enterprise-software/layer7-api-management/api-gateway/congw-11-0/release-notes_cgw.html) for important information regarding the procedure.

## 3.0.4 General Updates
OTK installation and upgrade is now supported as part of Gateway charts.  Please refer to [OTK Install or Upgrade](./README.md#otk-install-or-upgrade) for more details.
[Gateway-OTK](../gateway-otk) is now deprecated.

## 3.0.2 General Updates
***The default image tag in values.yaml and production-values.yaml now points at specific GA or CR versions of the API Gateway. The appVersion in Chart.yaml has also been updated to reflect that. As of this release, that is 10.1.00_CR2***

To reduce reliance on requiring a custom/derived gateway image for custom and modular assertions, scripts and restman bundles a bootstrap script has been introduced. The script works with the /opt/docker/custom folder.

The best way to populate this folder is with an initContainer where files can be copied directly across or dynamically loaded from an external source.
- [InitContainer Examples](https://github.com/Layer7-Community/Utilities/tree/main/gateway-init-container-examples) - this repository also contains examples for custom health checks and configuration files.

The following configuration options have been added
- [Custom Health Checks](./README.md#custom-health-checks)
- [Custom Configuration Files](./README.md#custom-configuration-files)
- [Topology Spread Constraints](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/topology-spread-constraints/#spread-constraints-for-pods)
- [Tolerations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/taint-and-toleration/)
- [Pod Security Context](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/#set-the-security-context-for-a-pod)
- [Container Security Context](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/#set-the-security-context-for-a-container)
- Http headers can also now be added to the liveness and readiness probes
- Ingress and HPA API Version validation has been updated to check for available APIs vs. KubeVersion
- SubCharts now show image repository and tags

### Upgrading to Chart v3.0.0
Please see the 3.0.0 updates, this release brings significant updates and ***breaking changes*** if you are using an external Hazelcast 3.x server. Services and Ingress configuration have also changed. Read the 3.0.0 Updates below and check out the [additional guides](./README.md#additional-guides) for more info.

## 3.0.0 Updates to Hazelcast
***Hazelcast 4.x/5.x servers are now supported*** this represents a breaking change if you have configured an external Hazelcast 3.x server.
- If you are using Gateway v10.1 and below you will either need to set *hazelcast.legacy.enabled=true* and use the following gateway image *docker.io/caapim/gateway:10.1.00_20220802* or update your external Hazelcast server.
- The included Hazelcast subChart has been updated to reflect this change

### 3.0.0 Updates to Ingress Configuration

- You can now configure [Gateway Ports.](./README.md#port-configuration)
  This does not cover Kubernetes Service level configuration which will ***need to be updated*** to reflect your changes.
