Thank you for installing the API Developer Portal v{{.Chart.AppVersion}} using Helm!

To learn more about the release, try:

  $ helm status {{ .Release.Name }} -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}

If this domain is not in your DNS records please add the following domains to your
hosts file or DNS server.

{{- if .Values.ingress.create }}
Because you deployed an ingress controller as part of this Chart you can get the EXTERNAL-IP with the command below

  $ kubectl get svc -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} | grep nginx
{{- else}}
  $ kubectl get svc -n <ingress-controller-namespace>
{{- end }}

After the all pods are successfully running you can access the portal at:

sso url: {{ include "pssg-sso-host" . }}

{{- if .Values.global.setupDemoDatabase }}
