## APIM Helm Charts
This repository will eventually contain a series of Helm Charts for the Layer7 API Management (APIM) Portfolio.


## Usage
Helm Charts are essentially 'packaged applications' that describe how the APIM solution shall be built in a Kubernetes cluster. Navigate into the Chart you'd like to deploy for more detail. 

Learn [why](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/ca-enterprise-software/layer7-api-management/api-gateway/congw-10-0/install-configure-upgrade/configuring-the-container-gateway.html) Layer7 recommends the Helm Chart for quickly deploying an APIM solution (e.g., the API Gateway) to Kubernetes. 

## Note
This Helm Chart was created by the Layer7 tactical team. Support will be provided on a best-effort basis until such time as this is approved by engineering. All Chart configurations referenced on this repository and other Layer7 APIM documentation are configurable via a <i>values.yaml</i> file. The samples provided in this repository can be used as a starting point to configure your installation for a production scenario.
